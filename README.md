# Toasty Polvo Production Planner

__A lightweight interactive dashboard + visual production planner that helps the founder forecast demand, plan production batches, and evaluate new opportunities!__

- **Figma Mockup**: shows how the tool looks and feels
- **Google Sheet Dashboard**: shows how it works and calculates

**From a team of two**: This is our first hackathon! This was challenging and so much fun to make. Thank you for the opportunity to do this, especially during Filipino American Heritage Month. Of course when doing anything for the first time, you feel a sense of panic, of what to include and what not to include. As a a team of two, we took the time to create prototypes of the webpage itself and how it could look on the admin's end, and developed an automated report using Google Sheets. 

> Here's our way of showing support to a AAPI woman-owned small business to bring their nostalgic dessert to more people.

## What It Does & How We Built It ðŸ¤”
This project uses Google Spreadsheets for the back/data end and Figma for the frontend. This project aims to plan production in a smarter, more efficient way that relies on an intuitive, easy-to-use system, rather than last-minute decisions. It answers questions like, "Can we handle a big event and fulfill online orders in the same week?" and "Should we say yes to this opportunity or it not worth the effort?"

We made sure to make a system that can deal with a tight budget, handmade batches, and a small team. 

## Challenges ðŸ˜¢
- Learned how to implement more financial strategies than data strategies
- Trouble with forecasting as the tool is not the most effective in Google Sheets
- Organizing Google Sheet tabs
- Managing and organizing components in a limited timeline
- Figuring out how to record a screen and get it to record
- Wireframing in a limited timeline

## Accomplishments ðŸ¥³
- Completed our first hackathon! 
- Working as a two person team with limited time and support
- Epic teamwork and communication
- Building a prototype to support the Filipino community
- Project management on Miro
- Utilized our skills to help a small business

__Salamat to Filipino Americans in Tech for this opportunity!__
